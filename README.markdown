Hooking Project Documentation
============================================
The Hooking Project documentation is generated using [bootDoc](https://github.com/JakobOvrum/bootDoc)
and can be viewed online [here](http://denis-sh.github.com/hooking/).

The documentation can be generated using `generate-docs.bat`.

It assumes that the `hooking` source package can be found as `../hooking`, i.e.
it assumes that this directory is a subdirectory of the main Hooking Project branch.
The Hooking Project `.gitignore` has a `/.generated-docs` entry for this purpose.
